ViewContainers are moved using ViewContainerRef.move()\n * causes the animation state of moved components to become `void` upon exit, and not update again\n * upon reentry into the DOM.  This can lead a to situation for the expansion panel where the state\n * of the panel is `expanded` or `collapsed` but the animation state is `void`.\n *\n * To correctly handle animating to the next state, we animate between `void` and `collapsed` which\n * are defined to have the same styles. Since angular animates from the current styles to the\n * destination state's style definition, in situations where we are moving from `void`'s styles to\n * `collapsed` this acts a noop since no style values change.\n *\n * In the case where angular's animation state is out of sync with the expansion panel's state, the\n * expansion panel being `expanded` and angular animations being `void`, the animation from the\n * `expanded`'s effective styles (though in a `void` animation state) to the collapsed state will\n * occur as expected.\n *\n * Angular Bug: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/18847\n *\n * \\@docs-private\n * @type {?}\n */\nconst matExpansionAnimations = {\n    /**\n     * Animation that rotates the indicator arrow.\n     */\n    indicatorRotate: trigger('indicatorRotate', [\n        state('collapsed, void', style({ transform: 'rotate(0deg)' })),\n        state('expanded', style({ transform: 'rotate(180deg)' })),\n        transition('expanded <=> collapsed, void => collapsed', animate(EXPANSION_PANEL_ANIMATION_TIMING)),\n    ]),\n    /**\n     * Animation that expands and collapses the panel header height.\n     */\n    expansionHeaderHeight: trigger('expansionHeight', [\n        state('collapsed, void', style({\n            height: '{{collapsedHeight}}',\n        }), {\n            params: { collapsedHeight: '48px' },\n        }),\n        state('expanded', style({\n            height: '{{expandedHeight}}'\n        }), {\n            params: { expandedHeight: '64px' }\n        }),\n        transition('expanded <=> collapsed, void => collapsed', group([\n            query('@indicatorRotate', animateChild(), { optional: true }),\n            animate(EXPANSION_PANEL_ANIMATION_TIMING),\n        ])),\n    ]),\n    /**\n     * Animation that expands and collapses the panel content.\n     */\n    bodyExpansion: trigger('bodyExpansion', [\n        state('collapsed, void', style({ height: '0px', visibility: 'hidden' })),\n        state('expanded', style({ height: '*', visibility: 'visible' })),\n        transition('expanded <=> collapsed, void => collapsed', animate(EXPANSION_PANEL_ANIMATION_TIMING)),\n    ])\n};\n\n/**\n * @fileoverview added by tsickle\n * @suppress {checkTypes,extraRequire,missingOverride,missingReturn,unusedPrivateMembers,uselessCode} checked by tsc\n */\n/**\n * Expansion panel content that will be rendered lazily\n * after the panel is opened for the first time.\n */\nclass MatExpansionPanelContent {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _template\n     */\n    constructor(_template) {\n        this._template = _template;\n    }\n}\nMatExpansionPanelContent.decorators = [\n    { type: Directive, args: [{\n                selector: 'ng-template[matExpansionPanelContent]'\n            },] },\n];\n/** @nocollapse */\nMatExpansionPanelContent.ctorParameters = () => [\n    { type: TemplateRef }\n];\n\n/**\n * @fileoverview added by tsickle\n * @suppress {checkTypes,extraRequire,missingOverride,missingReturn,unusedPrivateMembers,uselessCode} checked by tsc\n */\n/**\n * Counter for generating unique element ids.\n * @type {?}\n */\nlet uniqueId = 0;\n/**\n * Injection token that can be used to configure the defalt\n * options for the expansion panel component.\n * @type {?}\n */\nconst MAT_EXPANSION_PANEL_DEFAULT_OPTIONS = new InjectionToken('MAT_EXPANSION_PANEL_DEFAULT_OPTIONS');\nconst ɵ0 = undefined;\n/**\n * `<mat-expansion-panel>`\n *\n * This component can be used as a single element to show expandable content, or as one of\n * multiple children of an element with the MatAccordion directive attached.\n */\nclass MatExpansionPanel extends CdkAccordionItem {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} accordion\n     * @param {?} _changeDetectorRef\n     * @param {?} _uniqueSelectionDispatcher\n     * @param {?} _viewContainerRef\n     * @param {?} _document\n     * @param {?} _animationMode\n     * @param {?=} defaultOptions\n     */\n    constructor(accordion, _changeDetectorRef, _uniqueSelectionDispatcher, _viewContainerRef, _document, _animationMode, defaultOptions) {\n        super(accordion, _changeDetectorRef, _uniqueSelectionDispatcher);\n        this._viewContainerRef = _viewContainerRef;\n        this._animationMode = _animationMode;\n        this._hideToggle = false;\n        /**\n         * An event emitted after the body's expansion animation happens.\n         */\n        this.afterExpand = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * An event emitted after the body's collapse animation happens.\n         */\n        this.afterCollapse = new EventEmitter();\n        /**\n         * Stream that emits for changes in `\\@Input` properties.\n         */\n        this._inputChanges = new Subject();\n        /**\n         * ID for the associated header element.
