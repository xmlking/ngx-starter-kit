  **Monorepo != Monolith**

  > When you have all your codebase within the same repository it’s tempting to fall into the trap of creating a monolith (a gigantic application where all parts are intertwined with each other) so we need to ensure that modularity is a first class citizen within these repositories.

  > Each package has clearly defined boundaries and ownership.

- Shoud I use mergeMap or concatMap or switchMap or forkJoin for my usecase?

> _Short Answer_: concatMap for writes, mergeMap for reads, switchMap when you have to cancel http call.

> switchMap cancels previous inner Observables when a new inner Observable appears
